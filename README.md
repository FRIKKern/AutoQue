Intended use cases:
-------------------

### Spamming arenas, dungeons and stuff.

If you have a slow PC, it will hinder role check from resetting after leaving loading screen. Party leader will have a better time. I am usually the one who queue up, so i force my friends to use this.

### Groups signing up for mythic+, raids and stuff.

You can go AFK while waiting for a group to fill up. Accept once and chill.


### Reminder to queue up again after arena.

If you are the party leader, the addon will show a reminder to queue up again after arena.
