AutoQue 🔄️
===========

**AutoQue** smooth outs the role check acceptances in World of Warcraft, with some guardrails to prevent unintended acceptances.

Intended use cases:
-------------------

### Spamming arenas, dungeons and stuff.

If you have a slow PC, it will hinder role check from resetting after leaving loading screen. Party leader will have a better time. I am usually the one who queue up, so i force my friends to use this.

### Groups signing up for mythic+, raids and stuff.

You can go AFK while waiting for a group to fill up. Accept once and chill.
