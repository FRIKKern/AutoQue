# AutoQue 👁️

**AutoQue** enhances your World of Warcraft experience by automating role checks with precision and convenience. It builds upon the original [AutoQueue WeakAura](https://wago.io/3IxDUtinb) by **SindreMa**, making it a standalone addon with added features like inactivity auto-disable to prevent unintended acceptances.

## Automatic Role Check Acceptance ✅

- **Instant Acceptance:** Automatically accepts role checks as soon as they appear.
- **Never Miss a Queue:** Ensures you promptly join groups without manual intervention.

## Inactivity Auto-Disable ⏰

- **Smart Automation:** Automatically disables the addon after a user-defined period of inactivity (1 to 30 minutes).
- **AFK Protection:** Prevents unintended role acceptances when you're away from the keyboard, so you don't lose arena rating due to inactivity.

## Customizable Inactivity Timer ⚙️

- **User-Friendly Configuration:** Adjust the inactivity duration to fit your playstyle via an intuitive slider.
- **Flexible Timing:** Set the timer anywhere between 1 and 30 minutes.

## Minimap Icon Toggle 🖱️

- **Quick Control:** Enable or disable AutoQue with a simple left-click on the minimap icon.
- **Visual Indicators:** Green icon for enabled, red for disabled—know your status at a glance.

## Persistent Settings 💾

- **Set and Forget:** Your preferences are saved between sessions; no need to reconfigure each time you log in.
- **Reliable Performance:** Consistent behavior aligned with your chosen settings.

## Seamless Integration 🧩

- **Lightweight:** Minimal impact on game performance for smooth gameplay.
- **Intuitive Options Panel:** Access all settings within the standard interface options without clutter.

### Credits 🙏

Special thanks to **SindreMa** for the original [WeakAura](https://wago.io/3IxDUtinb) named *AutoQueue* that inspired the creation of AutoQue. This addon was developed to make it independent of WeakAuras and to add the inactivity auto-disable feature, so you don't lose for example arena rating due to clumsy inactivity.
