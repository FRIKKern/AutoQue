### Credits

Special thanks to **SindreMa** for the original [WeakAura](https://wago.io/3IxDUtinb) named AutoQueue that inspired the creation of AutoQue. 
I created this to make it independent of WeakAuras, and to add the inactivity auto-disable feature so i dont lose more arena rating due to inactivity.
